  <li>Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Computational Fluid Dynamics Engineer position at ExxonMobil. With my extensive experience in numerical simulation, mathematical modeling, and data analysis, I am confident that I possess the skills and expertise to excel in this role.

My research background in multiphysics systems has equipped me with a deep understanding of fluid dynamics and transport phenomena. I have developed and applied models in areas such as multiphase modeling, granular flow, and combustion. My proficiency in computational languages like Ansys Fluent, OpenFOAM, MatLab, Python, and C/C++ enables me to effectively simulate and analyze complex fluid flow systems.

Furthermore, my experience in high-performance computing has allowed me to handle large-scale simulations efficiently. I am also familiar with hybrid modeling techniques, including PINNs and AI/ML, which can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of my simulations.

I am eager to contribute my skills to ExxonMobil&#x27;s process development and scale-up programs. I am particularly interested in applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems and drive innovation in the energy industry. I am confident that my passion for physics-based modeling and my ability to work collaboratively will make me a valuable asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and demonstrate how I can contribute to the success of ExxonMobil.

Sincerely,
Yifei Duan</li>
